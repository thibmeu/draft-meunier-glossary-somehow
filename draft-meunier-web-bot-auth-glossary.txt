1.  Introduction

   Agents are increasingly used in business and user workflows,
   including AI assistants, search indexing, content aggregation, and
   automated testing.  These agents need to reliably identify themselves
   to origins for several reasons:

   1.  Regulatory compliance requiring transparency of automated systems

   2.  Origin resource management and access control

   3.  Protection against impersonation and reputation management

   4.  Service level differentiation between human and automated traffic

   Current identification methods such as IP allowlisting, User-Agent
   strings, or shared API keys have significant limitations in security,
   scalability, manageability, and fairness.  This document presents
   these examples, as well as possible paths to address them.

2.  Motivation

   There is an increase in agent traffic on the Internet.  Many agents
   choose to identify their traffic today via IP Address lists and/or
   unique User-Agents.  This is often done to demonstrate trust and
   safety claims, support allowlisting/denylisting the traffic in a
   granular manor, and enable sites to monitor and rate limit per agent
   operator.  However, these mechanisms have drawbacks:

   1.  User-Agent, when used alone, can be spoofed meaning anyone may
       attempt to act as that agent.  It is also overloaded - an agent
       may be using Chromium and wish to present itself as such to
       ensure rendering works, yet it still wants to differentiate its
       traffic to the site.

   2.  IP blocks alone can present a confusing story.  IPs on cloud
       plaforms have layers of ownership - the platform owns the IP and
       registers it in their published IP blocks, only to be re-
       published by the agent with little to bind the publication to the
       actual service provider that may be renting infra.  Purchasing
       dedicated IP blocks is expensive, time consuming, and requires
       significant specialist knowledge to set up.  These IP blocks may
       have prior reputation history that needs to be carefully
       inspected and managed before purchase and use.

   3.  An agent may go to every website on the Internet and share a
       secret with them like a Bearer from [OAUTH-BEARER-RFC].  This is
       impractical to scale for any agent beyond select partnerships,
       and insecure, as key rotation is challenging and becomes less
       secure as the consumers scale.

   Using well-established cryptography, we can instead define a simple
   and secure mechanism that empowers small and large agents to share
   their identity.

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *Agent*  An autonomous entityg that perceive the environment and can
      take actions on behalf of users.

   *Bot*  A type of agent that operates automatically, often performing
      repetitive tasks.  Bots may identify themselves or attempt to
      mimic human behavior.

   *Origin (Server)*  The primary server hosting the web content or
      service that an agent intends to access.

   *Application Firewall*  control incoming traffic to an origin based
      on a set of rules.  This may include but is not limited to IP
      filtering, User-Agent match, or cryptographic signature
      verification.

   *Reverse proxy*  An intermediary server that forwards client requests
      to the origin server, often performing functions like load
      balancing, authentication, or caching.

   *Browser*  A client application used to access web content.  Browsers
      may also be orchestrated.

   *Human*  A physical person, like you and me.

   *Rate limit*  A control mechanism that restricts access of an Agent
      to a resource provided by an Origin Server.  An Origin can decide
      to rate limit all connections from an individual Client, from a
      specific Provider, or to a specific resource.  This may be a fixed
      number of request, a budget, a time, location, legal.

   *Unlinkability*  A property ensuring that multiple interactions or
      credentials from the same agent cannot be correlated by the
      verifier.

   *Account*  Persistent identifier of an agent to an origin.  This
      requires a registration.

   *Registration*  The creation of an identity.  It can involve one time
      payment, a subscription, an account with user name/password, an
      age, a legal jurisdiction, others.

   *Issuer*  An entity that generates and provides credentials to agents
      after the Attester has verified certain attributes.

   *Attester*  An entity that evaluates an agent's characteristics or
      behavior and provides evidence to an Issuer to support credential
      issuance.

   *Verifier*  An entity that validates the authenticity and integrity
      of a credential presented by an agent.

4.  Web bot authentication categories

   We divide web bot authentication in three categories.

4.1.  Identifying providers

   Organizations operating bots may need to authenticate their agents to
   access certain web resources.  Authentication mechanisms can help
   distinguish legitimate bots from malicious ones.

   Examples:

   *  Web crawlers wanting to authenticate against origins such as
      search engines,

   *  Security companies that want to perform scans to identify
      malicious URLs,

   *  AI augmented queries that are looking to identify against a set of
      newspapers.

4.2.  User Account Identification

   Bots acting on behalf of registered users may require authentication
   to access user-specific data or services.

   Examples:

   *  Authenticating and authorizing a known user against a particular
      resources, such as a newspaper they have a subscription for,

   *  Most authorisation use cases for [MCP-AUTH] and [A2A-AUTH].

4.3.  Attribute-Based Access

   In scenarios where full identification is unnecessary or undesirable,
   agents may present credentials that attest to specific attributes
   without revealing their identity.

   Examples:

   *  Add a signal to limit visual CAPTCHA challenge such as
      [PRIVATE-ACCESS-TOKEN],

   *  Gating access to a resource for longstanding users such as [LOX],

   *  Search engine with a fixed number of request such as
      [PRIVACY-PASS-KAGI],

   *  Selective disclosure of a credential attribute (location, age)
      such as [PRIVATE-PROOF-API].

5.  Ecosystem overview

                /                                    ^
   +----------+/                                     ║
   |  Client  +                                    Trust
   +----------+\                                     ║
                \                                    v
                 \     +----------+            +-----+----+
                  '--->| Attester |----------->|  Issuer  |
                       +----------+            +----------+

   The ecosystem involves multiple actors: a credential issuer that
   requires an certain criteria to be passed via an attester, the client
   which an be a bot or human-mediated agent which IP is not known, and
   the web origin placed behind a reverse proxy that may be fronting its
   infrastructure.  The issuer provides cryptographic credentials to the
   client, which are then attached to requests and optionally verified
   by proxies before reaching the origin.  This chain allows for
   authentication without necessarily revealing identifying details to
   each intermediate.

5.1.  AI agent use example

   Humans and bots often interact with origins indirectly via clients
   like browsers, agents, or CLI tools.  These clients handle requests,
   potentially traversing reverse proxies that manage TLS termination,
   DDoS protection, and caching.

   The rise of advanced browser orchestration blurs lines between human-
   driven and automated requests, making reliable bot identification
   increasingly complex.

                                 +---------+            +---------------+

   The attester/issuer roles could be filled by the AI company, reverse
   proxy, origin, or a third party.  Origins need mechanisms to identify
   organizations, rate-limit individuals, and authenticate users without
   relying solely on client IP or heuristics presented in Section 2.

6.  Security goals and threat model

   The security model includes several actors: credential issuers,
   attesters, clients (bots or agents), reverse proxies, and origin
   servers.  The primary goals are to prevent impersonation, allow for
   credential revocation, support delegation and rotation, and maintain
   trust boundaries.

6.1.  Public vs private presentation

   If the Issuer is also the Origin or its reverse proxy, it is possible
   to use shared secrets for verification.  In cases where the issuer
   and verifier are different entities, asymmetric cryptography becomes
   necessary, allowing the bot to prove authenticity using a public key
   infrastructure.

6.2.  Single vs multi show

   Some credentials may be designed for one-time use only (for anti
   replay or privacy reasons), while others can support multiple
   presentations through the use of cryptographic derivation techniques.
   This distinction affects privacy, scalability, and implementation
   complexity.

6.3.  Transport

   Authentication tokens may be exchanged at different protocol layers
   and through different transports.  Each may have different
   deployment, performance, and security guarantees.

   For TLS, we have seen [REQ-MTLS] and [PRIVACYPASS-IN-TLS]
   respectively addressing Section 4.1 and Section 4.3.

   For HTTP, we see [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURE-FOR-BOTS] or
   [DPOP-AUTH-RFC], and [PRIVACYPASS-HTTP-AUTH-RFC] respectively
   addressing Section 4.1 and Section 4.3.  [OAUTH-BEARER-RFC] fits as
   well for Section 4.2.

   Other methods have been seen such as leveraging a dedicated format on
   top of a JavaScript API.  This is the case for W3C
   [PRIVATE-STATE-TOKEN] or the more recent [PRIVATE-PROOF-API].

   Focusing on AI specifically, it's worth mentioning two proponent
   protocol definition efforts:

   *  [A2A-AUTH] which follows [OPENAPI3-AUTH].  This means it allows
      for Basic, Bearer, API Keys, and [OAUTH2-RFC].  OpenAPI mentions
      using [HTTP-AUTHSCHEME] registry, but there does not seem to be a
      definition for recent schemes such as [PRIVACYPASS-HTTP-AUTH-RFC],
      [CONCEALED-AUTH-RFC], or [DPOP-AUTH-RFC].

   *  [MCP-AUTH] uses [OAUTH2-RFC] as a resource server.

6.4.  Round trip

   Protocols should thrive to minimise the number of round trips between
   a client and the issuer, and between clients and the origin.

7.  Key management and discovery

7.1.  Catalog

   Like there are registries to resolve IP address metadata, there are
   going to be registries to identify the owner of public key material.
   These are mentioned by [A2A-DISCOVERY] and [MCP-DISCOVERY].

   The primary goal of these catalog is to associate metadata to public
   key, and to discover them.  They SHOULD have some sort of tamper
   resistent, to prevent the provider of a catalog to provide from
   information.

   As an analogy, one can think of [CERTIFICATE-TRANSPARENCY-RFC], or
   the more recent effort in [KEY-TRANSPARENCY-ARCHITECTURE].

7.2.  Submission / out-of-band

   Sumbission is also going to happen out of band.  This is both for a
   practical reason -- it is simpler than setting up a catalog --, and
   for privacy reason given you don't have to expose information through
   a catalog.

7.3.  On-path

   Discovery may happen on-path, that is when a request arrives from a
   client to an origin.  This could be considered a trust on first use.
   While the level of trust is low, it could be viable for certain use
   cases.

   Such discovery could be via an HTTP header containing a domain name
   with a well-known, a URL, a certificate, others.

7.4.  Format

   There is a multitude of Key and directory format.  This include and
   is not limited to JWKS, CWKS, Privacy Pass, Agent Card, or HTTP
   Message Signatures.

8.  Security Considerations

   This glossary provides terminology for web bot authentication.  While
   this document does not define or recommend specific protocols,
   terminology choices have direct security implications:

   *Impersonation Resistance*  Clearly defined roles are essential for
      preventing entities from falsely claiming identities.

   *Credential Replay and Theft*  Definitions such as Section 6.2 help
      describe key mechanisms that mitigate the misuse of credentials if
      stolen.

   *Key Management*  Section 7 is key to protocol security, and has to
      be considered.

   In addition, protocols should consider decentralization [RFC9518] and
   end-user impact [RFC8890].

9.  Privacy Considerations

   Authentication mechanisms should minimize the collection and exposure
   of personal data.  Techniques like selective disclosure and
   unlinkability help protect user privacy.  Protocols should refer to
   [RFC6973].

   Multiple protocols are also likely to be used in coordination: to
   identify an orgnization, then to identify the User-Agent, and
   possibly rate limit.  It is important to consider the privacy of
   these layers together as well.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
